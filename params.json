No, I am not kidding or exaggerating. That is how much a USENET article 'costs' -- do not post a USENET article in vain.\r\n\r\nPlease always use asking in the USENET groups as the very, VERY, last resort. Always try to sort out the problem by yourself -- that way you'll learn how to solve more and more problems, all by yourself. Try these. No, FAQ is not something rude, they are there to help you. Read them. Read them again. Most of the time they solve your problem and you learn a lot more about many other things on the side.\r\n\r\n<strong>FAQs</strong>\r\n<h2>CGI in Particular</h2>\r\nThe following FAQs tell about CGI in Particular\r\nThe Idiot's Guide to Solving Perl/CGI Problems.\r\nDo not huff at the name because truly that 'I' word may well mean you.\r\nPerl CGI FAQ\r\nCGI FAQ\r\nCGI Security FAQ\r\nPerl in General\r\n\r\nThe following FAQs tell about Perl in General\r\nThe Perl AutoFAQ\r\nPerl FAQ\r\nPerl 4 to 5 Traps for the Unwary\r\nWhat the list is about?\r\n\r\n<strong>perl5-porters is a motley crew doing:</strong>\r\nporting perl5 to as many architectures as possible\r\n<strong>porting:</strong>\r\n100% clean compile + 120% clean 'make test'\r\n<strong>as possible:</strong>\r\ncurrently mainly the various UNIX variants and systems which support the POSIX interface but we certainly would not object to the Amiga, Atari, LynxOS, MPE, MS-DOS, MVS, Netware, (for example) people joining us.\r\nThe clean porting to the various platforms requires quite a lot rethinking of the Perl code to clearly separate the UNIX-scpecific parts from of the pure Perl \"core\".\r\nplanning, implementing, and testing, the various APIs both for the innards of Perl 5 and to the external world, both for extensions and for modules.\r\nIf you have some/lots-of spare time either to hack perl 5 code or just to test-compile new releases and patches, jump in.\r\n<h2>Current UNIX Platforms</h2>\r\nThe current UNIX porters cover (at least), only major versions listed:\r\nAIX 3, 4\r\nBSD/386 1\r\nConvexOS 10\r\nHPUX 9, 10\r\nDigital UNIX / DEC OSF/1 1, 2, 3, 4\r\nDG/UX 5\r\nLinux 1, 2\r\nIRIX 4, 5, 6\r\nInteractive 3\r\nMachTen 2, 4\r\nNextStep 3\r\nSCO 3\r\nSunOS 4, 5\r\nUltrix 4\r\nUNICOS 6, 7, 8, 9\r\nCurrent Other Platforms\r\n\r\nThe following non-UNIXy ports are included in the standard (source) distribution\r\nAmiga\r\nMac\r\nOS/2 (note that the OS/2 binary works on MS-DOS (&gt;=386), Win31, Win95, and WinNT (with some restrictions), last three require RSX extenders.\r\nQNX\r\nPlan 9\r\nVMS\r\nWin/NT (note: supposed to work for Win95 too)\r\nCurrent Other Platforms not included in the standard distribution\r\n\r\nThe following non-UNIXy ports are in progress/ready but not included in the standard (source) distribution\r\nAcorn RISC OS\r\nBeOS\r\nIf you happen to have an OS not mentioned above and you feel like you need Perl, send email to perl5-porters-request@perl.org with the word subscribe in the message body (not the subject).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
